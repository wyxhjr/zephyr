title: QEMU RISC-V IMSICS (Incoming MSI Controller - Supervisor Level)

description: |
  QEMU RISC-V IMSICS interrupt controller following the RISC-V AIA specification.
  This is a QEMU-specific implementation of the RISC-V IMSICS for supervisor level.

compatible: "qemu,imsic"

include: [base.yaml,interrupt-controller.yaml]

properties:

  reg:
    required: true
    description: |
      Base address and size of the IMSICS register block.
      The size should be at least 0x8000 bytes to cover all registers.

  "#interrupt-cells":
    const: 0
    description: |
      Should be 0 for IMSICS as it's an MSI controller.

  riscv,num-ids:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Number of interrupt identities supported by this IMSICS.
      Must be between 0 and 255. Defaults to 255.

  riscv,hart-id:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Hart ID associated with this IMSICS instance.
      If not specified, defaults to the instance number.

  riscv,guest-id:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Guest ID for virtualization support.
      Defaults to 0 if not specified.

  riscv,max-priority:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Maximum interrupt priority supported.
      Must be between 0 and 7. Defaults to 7.

  riscv,big-endian:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
      If true, registers are accessed in big-endian byte order.
      Defaults to false (little-endian).

  interrupts-extended:
    required: false
    description: |
      The external interrupt lines that this IMSICS connects to.
      Typically the S-External interrupt from each local CPU.

  msi-controller:
    type: boolean
    required: true
    description: |
      Indicates that this device is an MSI controller.

  status:
    required: false
