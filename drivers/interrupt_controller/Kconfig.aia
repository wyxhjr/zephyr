# RISC-V AIA (Advanced Interrupt Architecture) driver configuration

config RISCV_AIA
	bool "RISC-V AIA (Advanced Interrupt Architecture) driver"
	depends on RISCV
	help
	  This option enables the RISC-V AIA (Advanced Interrupt Architecture)
	  combined driver that handles both APLIC and IMSIC controllers.

	  The AIA driver provides a unified interface for managing interrupts
	  in RISC-V systems that implement the Advanced Interrupt Architecture.
	  It automatically routes interrupts to the appropriate controller
	  (APLIC for peripheral interrupts, IMSIC for MSI interrupts).

	  Say Y if you want to use the RISC-V AIA driver.

config RISCV_AIA_INIT_PRIORITY
	int "AIA driver initialization priority"
	default 50
	range 0 99
	help
	  Device driver initialization priority for the RISC-V AIA driver.
	  The AIA driver should be initialized after the individual APLIC
	  and IMSIC drivers, but before other drivers that depend on it.

config RISCV_AIA_MAX_SOURCES
	int "Maximum number of interrupt sources"
	default 1024
	range 1 1024
	help
	  Maximum number of interrupt sources supported by the AIA driver.
	  This includes both APLIC peripheral interrupts and IMSIC MSI interrupts.

config RISCV_AIA_MAX_PRIORITY
	int "Maximum interrupt priority level"
	default 7
	range 1 255
	help
	  Maximum interrupt priority level supported by the AIA driver.
	  This value should match the maximum priority supported by both
	  APLIC and IMSIC controllers.

config RISCV_AIA_MAX_HARTS
	int "Maximum number of harts supported"
	default 4
	range 1 8
	help
	  Maximum number of harts (hardware threads) supported by the AIA driver.
	  This value should match the number of harts in your RISC-V system.

config RISCV_AIA_MAX_GUESTS
	int "Maximum number of guests supported"
	default 1
	range 1 8
	help
	  Maximum number of guests supported by the AIA driver.
	  This value should match the virtualization capabilities of your system.

config RISCV_AIA_MSI_MODE_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable MSI mode support"
	default y
	help
	  This option enables support for Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI)
	  in the AIA driver. MSI mode allows interrupts to be sent as messages
	  to specific harts and guests.

	  Say Y if you want to use MSI mode for interrupt delivery.

config RISCV_AIA_DIRECT_MODE_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable direct mode support"
	default y
	help
	  This option enables support for direct interrupt delivery mode
	  in the AIA driver. Direct mode allows interrupts to be delivered
	  directly to harts without using MSI messages.

	  Say Y if you want to use direct mode for interrupt delivery.

config RISCV_AIA_DEBUG
	bool "Enable AIA driver debug output"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables debug output from the AIA driver, including
	  detailed logging of interrupt routing and controller operations.

	  Say Y if you want to debug the AIA driver or see detailed
	  information about interrupt handling.

config RISCV_AIA_STATISTICS
	bool "Enable AIA driver statistics"
	default y
	help
	  This option enables statistics collection in the AIA driver,
	  including counts of interrupts handled, MSI messages sent,
	  and error conditions encountered.

	  Say Y if you want to collect performance and usage statistics
	  from the AIA driver.
