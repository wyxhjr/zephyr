# IMSIC (Incoming MSI Controller) configuration options

menuconfig RISCV_IMSIC
	bool "RISC-V IMSIC (Incoming MSI Controller) support"
	depends on RISCV
	help
	  This option enables support for the RISC-V IMSIC (Incoming MSI Controller)
	  following the RISC-V AIA specification. The IMSIC handles incoming MSI
	  (Message Signaled Interrupts) and provides per-hart interrupt management.

config RISCV_IMSIC_INIT_PRIORITY
	int "IMSIC initialization priority"
	default 40
	help
	  IMSIC device driver initialization priority.
	  This priority should be set after the APLIC driver initialization
	  to ensure proper dependency ordering.

config RISCV_IMSIC_MAX_EID
	int "Maximum External Interrupt ID (EID)"
	range 0 63
	default 63
	help
	  Maximum External Interrupt ID (EID) supported by the IMSIC.
	  This should match the hardware implementation.

config RISCV_IMSIC_MAX_PRIORITY
	int "Maximum interrupt priority"
	range 0 7
	default 7
	help
	  Maximum interrupt priority supported by the IMSIC.
	  This should match the hardware implementation.

config RISCV_IMSIC_DEBUG
	bool "Enable IMSIC debug output"
	default n
	help
	  Enable debug output for the IMSIC driver.
	  This will print detailed information about IMSIC operations.
