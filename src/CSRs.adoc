[[CSRs]]
== Control and Status Registers (CSRs) Added to Harts

For each privilege level at which a RISC-V hart can take interrupt traps, the
Advanced Interrupt Architecture adds CSRs for interrupt control and
handling.

=== Machine-level CSRs

<<CSRs-M>> lists both the CSRs added for machine
level and existing machine-level CSRs whose size is changed by the
Advanced Interrupt Architecture. Existing CSRs `mie`, `mip`, and `mideleg` are widened to 64 bits to support a total of 64 interrupt causes.

For RV32, the _high-half_ CSRs listed in the table allow access to the
upper 32 bits of registers `mideleg`, `mie`, `mvien`, `mvip`, and `mip`. The Advanced Interrupt Architecture requires that these high-half CSRs exist for RV32, but the bits they access may all be merely read-only zeros.

CSRs `miselect` and `mireg` provide a window for accessing multiple registers beyond the CSRs in <<CSRs-M>>. The value of `miselect` determines which
register is currently accessible through alias CSR `mireg`. `miselect` is a *WARL* register, and it must support a minimum range of values depending on the implemented features. When an IMSIC is not implemented, `miselect` must be able to hold at least any 6-bit value in the range 0 to 0``x3F``. When an IMSIC is implemented, `miselect` must be able to hold any 8-bit value in the range 0 to 0``xFF``.
The Advanced Interrupt Architecture makes use
of these subranges of values for `miselect`:

Values of `miselect` with the most-significant bit set (bit
`XLEN - 1` = `1`) are designated for custom use,
presumably for accessing custom registers through `mireg`. If `XLEN` changes, the
most-significant bit of `miselect` moves to the new position, retaining its value
from before. An implementation is not required to support any custom
values for `miselect`.

Other `miselect` values are reserved for other RISC-V extensions.

[NOTE]
====
RISC-V extension Smcsrind generalizes the mechanism of
indirect register access provided by `miselect` and `mireg`.
====

Normally, the range for external interrupts, 0x70-0xFF, is populated only when
an IMSIC is implemented; else, attempts to access `mireg` when `miselect` is in this range
cause an illegal instruction exception. The contents of the
external-interrupts region are documented in
<<IMSIC>> on the IMSIC.

CSR `mtopei` also exists only when an IMSIC is implemented, so is documented in
<<IMSIC>> along with the indirectly accessed IMSIC
registers.

CSR `mtopi` reports the highest-priority interrupt that is pending and enabled
for machine level, as specified in <<mtopi>>.

When S-mode is implemented, CSRs `mvien` and `mvip` support interrupt filtering and
virtual interrupts for supervisor level. These facilities are explained
in <<virtIntrs-S>>.

If extension Smcsrind is also implemented, then when `miselect` has a value in the
range 0x30-0x3F
or 0x70-0xFF, attempts to access alias CSRs `mireg2` through `mireg6` raise an illegal
instruction exception.

=== Supervisor-level CSRs

<<CSRs-S>> lists the supervisor-level CSRs that are
added and existing CSRs that are widened to 64 bits, if the hart
implements S-mode. The functions of these registers all match their
machine-level counterparts.

The space of registers accessible through the `siselect`/`sireg` window is separate from
but parallels that of machine level, being for supervisor-level
interrupts instead of machine-level interrupts.
The subranges of values used for `siselect` are once again these:

[%autowidth,align="center",float="center",cols=">,<",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|`0x30-0x3F` |major interrupt priorities
|`0x70-0xFF` |external interrupts (only with an IMSIC)
|===

For maximum compatibility, it is recommended that `siselect` support at least a
9-bit range, `0` to `0x1FF`, regardless of whether an IMSIC exists.

[NOTE]
====
Because the VS CSR `vsiselect` (<<hypervisor-vs-csrs>>) always has at
least 9 bits, and like other VS CSRs, `vsiselect` substitutes for `siselect` when executing in
a virtual machine (VS-mode or VU-mode), implementing a smaller range for
`siselect` allows software to discover it is not running in a virtual machine.
====

Like `miselect`, values of `siselect` with the most-significant bit set (bit
XLEN - 1 = 1) are designated for custom use.
If XLEN changes, the most-significant bit of `siselect` moves to the new position,
retaining its value from before. An implementation is not required to
support any custom values for `siselect`.

Other `siselect` values are reserved for other RISC-V extensions.

[NOTE]
====
At supervisor level, extension Sscsrind generalizes the mechanism
of indirect register access provided by `siselect` and `sireg`,
as well as the parallel at VS-level provided by `vsiselect` and `vsireg`,
described in the next subsection.
====

Note that the widths of 'siselect' and 'sireg' are always the current XLEN rather than
SXLEN. Hence, for example, if MXLEN = 64 and SXLEN = 32, then these
registers are 64 bits when the current privilege mode is M (running RV64
code) but 32 bits when the privilege mode is S (RV32 code).

CSR `stopei` is described with the IMSIC in <<IMSIC>>.

Register `stopi` reports the highest-priority interrupt that is pending and
enabled for supervisor level, as specified in
<<stopi>>.

If extension Sscsrind is also implemented, then when `siselect` has a value in the range `0x30-0x3F` or `0x70-0xFF`, attempts to access alias CSRs `sireg2` through `sireg6` raise an illegal instruction exception (unless executing in a virtual machine, covered in the next section).

[[hypervisor-vs-csrs]]
=== Hypervisor and VS CSRs

If a hart implements the H extension,
then the hypervisor and VS CSRs listed in <<CSRs-hypervisor>> are also either added or widened to 64 bits.

The new hypervisor CSRs in the table (`hvien`, `hvictl` , `hviprio1`, and `hviprio2`) augment `hvip` for injecting interrupts into VS level. The use of these registers is covered in <<VSLevel>> on interrupts for virtual machines.

The new VS CSRs (`vsiselect`, `vsireg`, `vstopei`, and `vstopi`) all match supervisor CSRs, and substitute for those supervisor CSRs when executing in a virtual machine (in VS-mode or VU-mode).

CSR `vsiselect` is required to support at least a 9-bit range of `0` to `0x1FF`, whether or not an IMSIC is implemented. As with `siselect`, values of `vsiselect` with the most-significant bit set (bit XLEN - 1 = 1) are designated for custom use. If XLEN changes, the most-significant bit
of `vsiselect` moves to the new position, retaining its value from before.

Like `siselect` and `sireg`, the widths of `vsiselect` and `vsireg` are always the current XLEN rather than VSXLEN. Hence, for example, if HSXLEN = 64 and VSXLEN = 32, then these registers are 64 bits when accessed by a hypervisor in HS-mode (running RV64 code) but 32 bits for a guest OS in VS-mode (RV32 code).

|===

The space of registers selectable by `vsiselect` is more limited than for machine and supervisor levels:

[%autowidth,align="center",float="center",cols=">,<",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|`0x030-0x03F`| inaccessible
|`0x070-0x0FF`| external interrupts (IMSIC only), or inaccessible
|===

Other `vsiselect` values are reserved for other RISC-V extensions.

For alias CSRs `sireg` and `vsireg`, the H extension's usual rules for when to raise a virtual instruction exception (based on whether an instruction is _HS-qualified_) are not applicable. The rules given in this section for `sireg` and `vsireg` apply instead, unless overridden by the requirements of <<CSRs-stateen>>, which take precedence over this section
when extension Smstateen is also implemented.

A virtual instruction exception is raised for attempts from VS-mode or
VU-mode to directly access `vsireg`, or attempts from VU-mode to access `sireg`.

When `vsiselect` has the number of an _inaccessible_ register, attempts from M-mode or HS-mode to access `vsireg` raise an illegal instruction exception, and attempts from VS-mode to access `sireg` (really `vsireg`) raise a virtual instruction exception.

[NOTE]
====
Requiring a range of 0-0x1FF for `vsiselect`, even though most or all of the space is reserved or inaccessible, permits a hypervisor to emulate indirectly
accessed registers in the implemented range, including registers that
are not currently defined but may be standardized in the future.
====

The indirectly accessed registers for external interrupts (numbers 0x70-0xFF)
are accessible only when field VGEIN of `hstatus` is the number of an implemented guest external interrupt, not zero. If VGEIN is not the number of an implemented guest external interrupt (including the case when no IMSIC
is implemented), then all indirect register numbers in the ranges 0x030-0x03F and 0x070-0x0FF designate an inaccessible register at VS level.

Along the same lines, when `hstatus.VGEIN` is not the number of an implemented
guest external interrupt, attempts from M-mode or HS-mode to access CSR `vstopei` raise an illegal instruction exception, and attempts from VS-mode to
access `stopei` raise a virtual instruction exception.

If extension Sscsrind is also implemented, then when `vsiselect` has a value in the range 0x30-0x3F or 0x70-0xFF, attempts from M-mode or HS-mode to access alias CSRs `vsireg2` through `vsireg6` raise an illegal instruction exception, and attempts from VS-mode to access `sireg2` through `sireg6` raise a virtual instruction exception.

=== Virtual instruction exceptions

Following the default rules for the H extension, attempts from
VS-mode to directly access a hypervisor or VS CSR other than `vsireg`, or from
VU-mode to access any supervisor-level CSR (including hypervisor and VS
CSRs) other than `sireg` or `vsireg`, usually raise not an illegal instruction exception but instead a virtual instruction exception. For details, see the H extension documentation.

Instructions that read/write CSR `stopei` or `vstopei` are considered to be _HS-qualified_ unless all of following are true: the hart has an IMSIC, extension Smstateen is implemented, and bit 58 of `mstateen0` is zero. (See the next section, <<CSRs-stateen>>, about `mstateen0`.)

For `sireg` and `vsireg`, see both the previous section, <<hypervisor-vs-csrs>>, and the next, <<CSRs-stateen>>, for when a virtual instruction exception is required instead of an illegal instruction exception.

[[CSRs-stateen]]
=== Access control by the state-enable CSRs

If extension Smstateen is implemented together with the Advanced
Interrupt Architecture (AIA), three bits of state-enable register `mstateen0` control access to AIA-added state from privilege modes less privileged
than M-mode:

[%autowidth,align="center",float="center",cols="<",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|bit 60 CSRIND: CSRs `siselect`, `sireg`, `vsiselect`, and `vsireg`
|bit 59 AIA: all other state added by the AIA and not controlled by bits CSRIND and IMSIC
|bit 58 IMSIC: all IMSIC state, including CSRs `stopei` and `vstopei`
|===

If one of these bits is zero in `mstateen0`, an attempt to access the corresponding state from a privilege mode less privileged than M-mode results in an illegal instruction trap. As always, the state-enable CSRs do not affect
the accessibility of any state when in M-mode, only in less privileged modes. For more explanation, see the documentation for extension Smstateen.

The AIA bit controls access to AIA CSRs `siph`, `sieh`, `stopi`, `hidelegh`, `hvien`/`hvienh`, `hviph`, `hvictl`, `hviprio1`/`hviprio1h`, `hviprio2`/`hviprio2h`, `vsiph`, `vsieh`, and `vstopi`, as well as to the supervisor-level interrupt priorities accessed through `siselect` + `sireg` (the `iprio` array of <<intrPrios-S>>).

The IMSIC bit is implemented in `mstateen0` only if the hart has an IMSIC. If the
H extension is also implemented, this bit does not affect the
behavior or accessibility of hypervisor CSRs `hgeip` and `hgeie`, or field VGEIN of `hstatus`. In particular, guest external interrupts from an IMSIC continue to be visible to HS-mode in `hgeip` even when `mstateen0`.IMSIC is zero.

[NOTE]
====
An earlier, pre-ratification draft of Smstateen said that when `mstateen0`.IMSIC is zero, registers `hgeip` and `hgeie` and field VGEIN of `hstatus` are all read-only zeros. That effect is no longer correct.
====

If the hart does not have an IMSIC, the IMSIC bit of `mstateen0` is read-only zero, but Smstateen has no effect on attempts to access the nonexistent IMSIC
state.

[NOTE]
====
This means in particular that, when the hart does not have an IMSIC, the
following raise a virtual instruction exception as described in <<CSRs-hypervisor>>, not an illegal instruction exception, despite that `mstateen0`.IMSIC is zero:

* attempts from VS-mode to access `sireg` (really `vsireg`) while `vsiselect` has a value in the range 0x70–0xFF; and
* attempts from VS-mode to access `stopei` (really `vstopei`).
====

If the CSRIND bit of `mstateen0` is one, then regardless of any other `mstateen` bits (including the AIA and IMSIC bits of `mstateen0`), a virtual instruction exception is raised as described in <<hypervisor-vs-csrs>> for all attempts from VS-mode or
VU-mode to directly access `vsireg`, and for all attempts from VU-mode to access `sireg`. This behavior is overridden only when `mstateen0`.CSRIND is zero.

If the H extension is implemented, the same three bits are
defined also in hypervisor CSR `hstateen0` but concern only the state potentially accessible to a virtual machine executing in privilege modes VS and VU:

[%autowidth,align="center",float="center",cols="<",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|bit 60 CSRIND: CSRs `siselect` and `sireg` (really `vsiselect` and `vsireg`)
|bit 59 AIA: CSRs `siph` and `sieh` (RV32 only) and `stopi` (really `vsiph`, `vsieh`, and `vstopi`)
|bit 58 IMSIC: all state of IMSIC guest interrupt files, including CSR `stopei`(really `vstopei`)
|===

If one of these bits is zero in `hstateen0`, and the same bit is one in `mstateen0`, then an attempt to access the corresponding state from VS or VU-mode raises a virtual instruction exception. (But note that, for high-half CSRs `siph` and `sieh`, this applies only when XLEN = 32. When XLEN > 32, an attempt to access `siph` or `sieh` raises an illegal instruction exception as usual, not a virtual instruction exception.)

If the CSRIND bit is one in `mstateen0` but is zero in `hstateen0`, then all attempts from VS or VU-mode to access `siselect` or `sireg` raise a virtual instruction exception, not an illegal instruction exception, regardless of the value of `vsiselect` or any other `mstateen` bits.

The IMSIC bit is implemented in `hstateen0` only if the hart has an IMSIC. Furthermore, even with an IMSIC, `hstateen0`.IMSIC may (or may not) be read-only zero if the IMSIC has no _guest interrupt files_ for guest external interrupts (<<IMSIC>>). When this bit is zero (whether read-only zero or set to zero), a virtual machine is prevented from accessing the hart's IMSIC the same as when `hstatus.VGEIN` = 0.

Extension Ssstateen is defined as the supervisor-level view of Smstateen. Therefore, the combination of Ssaia and Ssstateen incorporates the bits defined above for `hstateen0` but not those for `mstateen0`, since machine-level CSRs are not visible to supervisor level.
