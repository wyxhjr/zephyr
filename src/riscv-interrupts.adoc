This document describes an Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA) for RISC-V
systems. This specification was ratified by the RISC-V International
Association in June of 2023.

The table below indicates which chapters of this document specify
extensions to the RISC-V ISA (instruction set architecture) and which
are non-ISA.

[cols="<,^",options="header",]
|===
|Chapter |ISA?
|1. Introduction |—
|2. Control and Status Registers (CSRs) Added to Harts |Yes
|3. Incoming MSI Controller (IMSIC) |Yes
|4. Advanced Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (APLIC) |No
|5. Interrupts for Machine and Supervisor Levels |Yes
|6. Interrupts for Virtual Machines (VS Level) |Yes
|7. Interprocessor Interrupts (IPIs) |No
|8. IOMMU Support for MSIs to Virtual Machines |No
|===

*Changes for version 20250312*

Made the following clarifications to AIA 1.0:

* Where there are irreconcilable conflicts between the AIA and other
implemented RISC-V extensions, the AIA usually has priority by default.
* Deference is given to extension
Smcsrind/Sscsrind (indirectly accessed CSRs).
* Names are given to the bits defined in `mstateen0` and `hstateen0`
when extension Smstateen/Ssstateen is also implemented.
* An IMSIC interrupt file's `eidelivery` register affects only
whether an interrupt appears in a hart's `mip` or `hgeip` register.
* IMSIC CSRs `mtopei`, `stopei`, and `vstopei` are not affected
by the values of `mie`, `sie`, `hie`, `hgeie`, or `vsie`.
* There may be a visible delay between a change of state of an IMSIC
interrupt file and its effect on a bit in `mip`, `sip`, or `hgeip`.
* An APLIC's `idelivery` registers and
the IE bits of its `domaincfg` registers affect only whether
pending-and-enabled interrupts are delivered to harts.
* The default priority order for major interrupts is applicable
only when multiple interrupts would trap to the same privilege mode.
* The example pseudocode given for handling major interrupts at M-level
and S-level has additional requirements not mentioned previously.
* An interrupt priority number in the S-level `iprio` array
may be writable (not read-only zero) if
the correponding bit is writable in either `sie` or `hie`.
* If a supervisor external interrupt (SEI) is injected from M-level
when there is no actual interrupt from an external interrupt controller,
the injected SEI is assigned an S-level priority number of 256.
* CSR `hvictl` affects only `vstopi` and the trapping of
some instructions, not `mip`, `sip`, `hip`, or `vsip`.

*Changes for the ratified version 1.0*

Resolved some inconsistencies in <<CSRs>> about when to raise
a virtual instruction exception versus an illegal instruction exception.

*Changes for RC5 (Release Candidate 5)*

Better aligned the rules for indirectly accessed registers with the
hypervisor extension and with forthcoming extension Smcsrind/Sscsrind.
In particular, when `vsiselect` has a reserved value, attempts to
access `sireg` from a virtual machine (VS or VU-mode) should
preferably raise an illegal instruction exception instead of a virtual
instruction exception.

Added clarification about the term _IOMMU_ used in <<IOMMU>>.

Added clarification about MSI write replaced by MRIF update and notice
MSI sent after the update.

*Changes for RC4*

For alignment with other forthcoming RISC-V ISA extensions, the widths
of the indirect-access CSRs, `miselect`, `mireg`, `siselect`,
`sireg`, `vsiselect`, and `vsireg`, were changed to all be the
current XLEN rather than being tied to their respective privilege levels
(previously MXLEN for `miselect` and `mireg`, SXLEN for `siselect`
and `sireg`, and VSXLEN for `vsiselect` and `vsireg`).

Changed the description (but not the actual function) of _high-half_
CSRs and their partner CSRs to match the latest RISC-V Privileged ISA
specification. (An example of a high-half CSR is `miph`, and its
partner here is `mip`.)

*Changes for RC3*

Removed the still-draft Duo-PLIC chapter to a separate document.

Allocated major interrupts 35 and 43 for signaling RAS events
(<<majorIntrs>>).

In <<virtIntrs-S>> added the options for bits 1 and 9 to
be writable in CSR `mvien`, and specified the effects of setting each
of these bits.

Upgraded <<IOMMU>> ("IOMMU Support") to the _frozen_ state.

*Changes for RC2*

Clarified that field IID of CSR `hvictl` must support all unsigned
integer values of the number of bits implemented for that field, and
that writes to `hvictl` always set IID in the most straightforward
way.

A comment was added to <<IPIs>> warning about the possible
need for FENCE instructions when IPIs are sent to other harts by writing
MSIs to those harts' IMSICs.
