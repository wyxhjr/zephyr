[[VSLevel]]
== Interrupts for Virtual Machines (VS Level)

When the H extension is implemented, a hart's set of possible
privilege modes includes the _virtual supervisor_ (VS) and _virtual
user_ (VU) modes for hosting virtual harts. The Advanced Interrupt
Architecture adds to the H extension new interrupt facilities
aligned with those described earlier for supervisor-level interrupts.

As introduced in <<CSRs>>, several hypervisor and VS
CSRs are added: `hvien`, `hvictl`, `hviprio1`, `hviprio2`, `vsiselect`, `vsireg`, `vstopei`, and `vstopi`. (And for RV32, the following
high-half CSRs are also added: `hidelegh`, `hvienh`, `hviph`, `hviprio1h`, `hviprio2h`, `vsiph` and `vsieh`.) As always, when
executing in VS-mode or VU-mode, the VS CSRs substitute for the
corresponding supervisor CSRs.

To give software that runs in a virtual machine the appearance of
executing on a real machine that implements the Advanced Interrupt
Architecture at supervisor level, responsibility is shared between
hypervisor software and the hardware facilities described in this
chapter. While some behaviors can be handled directly by hardware,
others require significant emulation by the hypervisor, sometimes with
hardware assistance.

=== VS-level external interrupts with a guest interrupt file

When a hart implements the H extension, it is recommended that
the hart also have an IMSIC with guest interrupt files. Assuming guest
interrupt files are available, each can be assigned to a virtual hart at
the physical hart to act as the supervisor-level interrupt file for that
virtual hart. If there are latexmath:[$N$] guest interrupt files, then
latexmath:[$N$] virtual harts at that physical hart may each have a
physical guest interrupt file to serve as its (virtual) supervisor-level
interrupt file. The guest interrupt file for the current virtual hart is
always indicated by the VGEIN field of CSR `hstatus`. When VGEIN is not the valid
number of a guest interrupt file, the current virtual hart has no guest
interrupt file to act as its supervisor-level interrupt file.

When `hstatus`.VGEIN is the valid number of a guest interrupt file, values of `vsiselect` in
the range `0x70`-`0xFF` select registers of this guest interrupt file, just as
values of `siselect` in the same range select registers of the IMSIC's true
supervisor-level interrupt file. The registers of an interrupt file that
are accessed indirectly through `vsiselect` and `vsireg` are documented in
<<IMSIC>> on the IMSIC, along with IMSIC-only CSR `vstopei`.
Because all IMSIC interrupt files act identically, the guest interrupt
file that a virtual hart accesses through CSRs `siselect`, `sireg`, and `stopei` is
indistinguishable from a true supervisor-level interrupt file as seen
from S-mode (or HS-mode).

In addition to an IMSIC at each hart, a virtual machine may also need to
see a PLIC or APLIC. However, unlike an IMSIC's ability to provide
physical guest interrupt files for virtual harts, a PLIC or APLIC must
be emulated for a virtual machine by the hypervisor.

[NOTE]
====
The Advanced Interrupt Architecture does not currently include hardware
assistance for virtualizing an APLIC. For small numbers of harts, such
hardware would be substantially larger than that required to implement
guest interrupt files for an IMSIC. It is assumed that most
high-performance I/O can be done through devices that can send MSIs
directly to guest interrupt files (such as devices attached through a
PCI Express interconnect). For the types of devices whose interrupts
must go through a (virtual) APLIC, the overhead cost of emulating the
APLIC is expected to be less significant.
====

When a virtual hart appears to have an IMSIC because a guest interrupt
file is assigned to it, all external interrupts, real or emulated,
destined for the virtual hart must go through this perceived IMSIC. A
hypervisor can easily inject an emulated external interrupt into the
guest interrupt file selected by `hstatus`.VGEIN by setting a bit in the
interrupt-pending array indirectly accessed through `vsiselect` and `vsireg`. When a virtual
hart has a guest interrupt file, a hypervisor is not normally expected
to set bit VSEIP in CSR `hvip`.

In the special case that an emulated APLIC for a virtual machine has a
wired interrupt source that equates to an actual interrupt source of a
real APLIC, if software running in this virtual machine configures its
virtual APLIC to forward interrupts from that source as MSIs to a
specific virtual hart, the hypervisor can configure the real APLIC to
forward the actual interrupts directly as MSIs to the virtual hart’s
guest interrupt file. In this way, although the hypervisor must trap and
emulate the virtual machine’s memory accesses that configure the
forwarding of interrupts at the virtual APLIC, the interrupts themselves
can be converted automatically into real MSIs for the guest interrupt
file, without the hypervisor being invoked for each arriving interrupt.

==== Direct control of a device by a guest OS

To ensure proper support for interrupts, two conditions must be met
before a hypervisor may allow a guest OS running in a virtual machine to
directly control a physical device that sends MSIs: First, each virtual
hart must have a guest interrupt file assigned to it, giving each its
own apparent IMSIC within the virtual machine. Second, interrupts from
the device must be signaled by wire through an APLIC that can translate
these interrupts into MSIs, or the system must have an IOMMU that can
translate the addresses of MSI memory writes made by the device itself.

If a guest OS directly controls a device capable of sending MSIs, it
will naturally configure MSIs at the device with the guest physical
addresses the OS sees for the IMSICs of its virtual harts, not knowing
that these addresses are only virtual. When the device performs a memory
write for an MSI, the destination address of this write must be
translated by the IOMMU from the guest physical address assigned by the
guest OS into the true physical address of the target guest interrupt
file, using a translation table supplied by the hypervisor.

By design, the translation an IOMMU must do for device MSIs is
fundamentally no different than the address translation the IOMMU
already must perform for other memory accesses from the same device,
converting guest physical addresses into true physical addresses.
Because each virtual hart is assigned a dedicated, physical guest
interrupt file that is indistinguishable from a true supervisor-level
interrupt file, no translation is needed for the data of an MSI write,
which specifies the interrupt's identity number in the target interrupt
file.

[[virtHartMigration]]
==== Migrating a virtual hart to a different guest interrupt file

When it is necessary to move a virtual hart from one physical hart to
another, if the virtual hart uses a guest interrupt file, the specific
guest interrupt file assigned to it must change from the one in use at
the old physical hart to a different one at the new physical hart.
Because each guest interrupt file is physically tied to a single
physical hart, a virtual hart cannot bring its guest interrupt file with
it when it moves.

The process of migrating a virtual hart from one guest interrupt file to
another is more complex than moving most other state held by the virtual
hart. After the destination guest interrupt file has been chosen at the
new physical hart, the following steps are recommended:

. At the old interrupt file, save to memory the values of registers `eidelivery` and
`eithreshold`, and set `eidelivery` = 0.
. At the new interrupt file, set `eidelivery` = 0, and zero all implemented
interrupt-pending bits (the `eip` array).
. Modify the relevant translation tables at all IOMMUs so that MSIs for
this virtual interrupt file are now sent to the new physical interrupt
file. Likewise, if any interrupts at an APLIC are forwarded by MSIs to
the old interrupt file, reconfigure the APLIC to send them to the new
interrupt file. As needed, synchronize with all IOMMUs and APLICs to
ensure that no straggler MSIs will arrive at the old interrupt file
after this step. Synchronizing with an APLIC can be accomplished using
the algorithm of <<AdvPLIC-MSISync>>.
. At the old interrupt file, dump to memory all implemented
interrupt-pending and interrupt-enable bits (the `eip` and `eie` arrays). After this
step is done, the old interrupt file is no longer in use.
. At the new interrupt file, logically OR the interrupt-pending bits
that were saved in step 4 into the new interrupt file, using instruction
CSRS to write to the `eip` array. Also, load the interrupt-enable bits that
were saved in step 4 into the `eie` array.
. At the new interrupt file, load registers `eithreshold` and `eidelivery` with the values that
were saved in step 1.

Resuming execution of the virtual hart at the new physical hart is not
recommended until the entire interrupt file has been fully migrated.

[NOTE]
====
Resuming execution of the virtual hart before the interrupt file is
fully migrated could allow software running in the virtual machine to
see multiple MSIs arriving from a single device in an order that should
not happen. While this would rarely matter in practice, it runs the risk
of wedging a device driver that depends (perhaps inadvertently) on a
valid ordering of events.
====

=== VS-level external interrupts without a guest interrupt file

Although it is recommended that harts implementing the hypervisor
extension also have IMSICs with guest interrupt files, this is not a
requirement. Even assuming guest interrupt files exist, it may happen
that there are more virtual harts at a physical hart than guest
interrupt files, leaving some virtual harts without one. In either case,
a hypervisor must emulate an external interrupt controller for a virtual
hart without the benefit of a guest interrupt file allocated to the
virtual hart.

When emulating an external interrupt controller for a virtual hart, if
configurable interrupt priority is not supported for the virtual hart
other than for external interrupts, then external interrupts may be
asserted to VS level simply by setting bit VSEIP in `hvip`, as defined by the
H extension. However, to emulate both an external interrupt
controller and priority configurability for non-external interrupts, a
hypervisor must make use of CSR `hvictl` (Hypervisor Virtual Interrupt Control),
described later in the next section.

=== Interrupts at VS level

==== Configuring priorities of major interrupts at VS level

Like for supervisor level, the Advanced Interrupt Architecture
optionally allows major VS-level interrupts to be configured by software
to intermix in priority with VS-level external interrupts. As documented
in <<intrs-S>>, interrupt priorities for
supervisor level are configured by the `iprio` array accessed indirectly through
CSRs `siselect` and `sireg`. The `siselect` addresses for the `iprio` array registers are `0x30`-`0x3F`.

VS level has its own `vsiselect` and `vsireg`, but unlike supervisor level, there are no
registers at `vsiselect` addresses `0x30`-`0x3F`. When `vsiselect` has a value in the range `0x30`-`0x3F`, an attempt
from VS-mode to access `sireg` (really `vsireg`) causes a virtual instruction exception.
To give a virtual hart the illusion of an array of `iprio` registers accessed
through `siselect` and `sireg`, a hypervisor must emulate the VS-level `iprio` array when accesses
to `sireg` from VS-mode cause virtual instruction traps.

Instead of a physical VS-level `iprio` array, a separate hardware mechanism is
provided for configuring the priorities of a subset of interrupts for VS
level, using hypervisor CSRs `hviprio1` and `hviprio2`. The subset of major interrupt numbers
whose priority may be configured in hardware are these:

[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",cols="^,<",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|1 |Supervisor software interrupt
|5 |Supervisor timer interrupt
|13|Counter overflow interrupt
|14-23|_Reserved for standard local interrupts_
|===

For interrupts directed to VS level, software-configurable priorities
are not supported in hardware for standard local interrupts in the range
32-48.

[NOTE]
====
For custom interrupts, priority configurability may be supported in
hardware by custom CSRs, expanding upon `hviprio1` and `hviprio2` for standard interrupts.
====

Registers `hviprio1` and `hviprio2` have these formats:

`hviprio1`:

[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",cols="<,<",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|bits 7:0 | _Reserved for priority number for interrupt 0; reads as
zero_
|bits 15:8 | Priority number for interrupt 1, supervisor software
interrupt +
|bits 23:16 | _Reserved for priority number for interrupt 4; reads as
zero_
|bits 31:24 | Priority number for interrupt 5, supervisor timer
interrupt
|bits 39:32 | _Reserved for priority number for interrupt 8; reads as
zero_ 
|bits 47:40 | Priority number for interrupt 13, counter overflow
interrupt 
|bits 55:48 | Priority number for interrupt 14
|bits 63:56 | Priority number for interrupt 15
|===

`hviprio2`:
[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",cols="<,<",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|bits 7:0 | Priority number for interrupt 16
|bits 15:8 | Priority number for interrupt 17
|bits 23:16 | Priority number for interrupt 18
|bits 31:24 | Priority number for interrupt 19
|bits 39:32 | Priority number for interrupt 20
|bits 47:40 | Priority number for interrupt 21
|bits 55:48 | Priority number for interrupt 22
|bits 63:56 | Priority number for interrupt 23
|===

Each priority number in `hviprio1` and `hviprio2` is a *WARL* unsigned integer field that is either
read-only zero or implements a minimum of IPRIOLEN bits or 6 bits,
whichever is larger, and preferably all 8 bits. Implementations may
freely choose which priority number fields are read-only zeros, but all
other fields must implement the same number of integer bits. A minimal
implementation of these CSRs has them both be read-only zeros.

A hypervisor can choose to employ registers `hviprio1` and `hviprio2` when emulating the
(virtual) supervisor-level `iprio` array accessed indirectly through `siselect` and `sireg` (really
`vsiselect` and `vsireg`) for a virtual hart. For interrupts not in the subset supported by
`hviprio1` and `hviprio2`, the priority number bytes in the emulated `iprio` array can be read-only
zeros.

[NOTE]
====
Providing hardware support for configurable priority for only a subset
of major interrupts at VS level is a compromise. The utility of being
able to control interrupt priorities at VS level is arguably illusory
when all traps to M-mode and HS-mode—both interrupts and synchronous
exceptions—have absolute priority, and when each virtual hart may also
be competing for resources against other virtual harts well beyond its
control. Nevertheless, priority configurability has been made possible
for the most likely subset of interrupts, while minimizing the number of
added CSRs that must be swapped on a virtual hart switch.

Major interrupts outside the priority-configurable subset can still be
directed to VS level, but their priority will simply be the default
order defined in <<majorIntrs>>.
====

If a hypervisor really must emulate configurability of priority for
interrupts beyond the subset supported by `hviprio1` and `hviprio2`, it can do so with extra
effort by setting bit VTI of CSR `hvictl`, described in the next subsection.

==== Virtual interrupts for VS level

Assuming a virtual hart does not need configurable priority for major
interrupts beyond the subset supported in hardware by `hviprio1` and `hviprio2`, a hypervisor
can assert interrupts to the virtual hart using CSRs `hvien` (Hypervisor
Virtual-Interrupt-Enable) and `hvip` (Hypervisor Virtual-Interrupt-Pending
bits). These CSRs affect interrupts for VS level much the same way that `mvien`
and `mvip` do for supervisor level, as explained in
<<virtIntrs-S>>.

Each bit of registers `hvien` and `hvip` corresponds with an interrupt number in the
range 0-63. Bits 12:0 of `hvien` are reserved and must be read-only zeros, while
bits 12:0 of `hvip` are defined by the H extension. Specifically,
bits 10, 6, and 2 of `hvip` are writable bits that correspond to VS-level
external interrupts (VSEIP), VS-level timer interrupts (VSTIP), and
VS-level software interrupts (VSSIP), respectively.

The following applies only to the CSR bits for interrupt numbers 13-63:
When a bit in `hideleg` is one, then the same bit position in `vsip` is an alias for the
corresponding bit in `sip`. Else, when a bit in `hideleg` is zero and the matching bit
in `hvien` is one, the same bit position in `vsip` is an alias for the corresponding
bit in `hvip`. A bit in `vsip` is read-only zero when the corresponding bits in `hideleg` and `hvien`
are both zero. The combined effects of `hideleg` and `hvien` on `vsip` and `vsie` are summarized in <<intrFilteringForVS>>.

[[intrFilteringForVS]]
.The effects of `hideleg` and `hvien` on `vsip` and `vsie` for major interrupts 13-63.
[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",cols="^,^,^,^",options="header"]
|===
|`hideleg`[latexmath:[$n$]] |`hvien`[latexmath:[$n$]] |`vsip`[latexmath:[$n$]] |`vsie`[latexmath:[$n$]]
|0 |0 |Read-only 0 |Read-only 0
|0 |1 |Alias of `hvip`[latexmath:[$n$]] |Writable
|1 |- |Alias of `sip`[latexmath:[$n$]] |Alias of `sie`[latexmath:[$n$]]
|===

For interrupt numbers 13-63, a bit in `vsie` is writable if and only if the
corresponding bit is set in either `hideleg` or `hvien`. When an interrupt is delegated
by `hideleg`, the writable bit in `vsie` is an alias of the corresponding bit in `sie`; else
it is an independent writable bit. The H extension specifies
when bits 12:0 of `vsie` are aliases of bits in `hie`. As usual, bits that are not
writable in `vsie` must be read-only zeros.

If a bit of `hideleg` is zero and the corresponding bit in `hvien` is changed from zero to
one, then the value of the matching bit in `vsie` becomes UNSPECIFIED. Likewise, if a bit
of `hvien` is one and the corresponding bit in `hideleg` is changed from one to zero, the
value of the matching bit in `vsie` again becomes UNSPECIFIED.

For interrupt numbers 13-63, implementations may freely choose which
bits of `hvien` are writable and which bits are read-only zero or one. If such a
bit in `hvien` is read-only zero (preventing the virtual interrupt from being
enabled), the same bit should be read-only zero in `hvip`. All other bits for
interrupts 13-63 must be writable in `hvip`.

CSR `hvictl` (Hypervisor Virtual Interrupt Control) provides further flexibility
for injecting interrupts into VS level in situations not fully supported
by the facilities described thus far, but only with more active
involvement of the hypervisor. A hypervisor must use `hvictl` for any of the
following:

* asserting for VS level a major interrupt not supported by `hvien` and `hvip`;
* implementing configurability of priorities at VS level for major
interrupts beyond those supported by `hviprio1` and `hviprio2`; or
* emulating an external interrupt controller for a virtual hart without
the use of an IMSIC’s guest interrupt file, while also supporting
configurable priorities both for external interrupts and for major
interrupts to the virtual hart.

[NOTE]
====
Among the possible uses, `hvictl` is needed for a hypervisor
to fully emulate HS-mode in VS-mode, which is a requirement for
the hosting of nested hypervisors without paravirtualization.
====

The format of `hvictl` is:

[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",cols="<,<",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|bit 30 |VTI
|bits 27:16 |IID (*WARL*)
|bit 9 |DPR
|bit 8 |IPRIOM
|bits 7:0 |IPRIO
|===

All other bits of `hvictl` are reserved and read as zeros.

When bit VTI (Virtual Trap Interrupt control) = 1, attempts from VS-mode
to explicitly access CSRs `sip` and `sie` (or, for RV32 only, `siph` and `sieh`) cause a virtual
instruction exception. Furthermore, for any given CSR, if there is some
circumstance in which a write to the register may cause a bit of `vsip` to
change from one to zero, excluding bit 9 for external interrupts (SEIP),
then when VTI = 1, a virtual instruction exception is raised also for
any attempt by the guest to write this register. Both the value being
written to the CSR and the value of `vsip` (before or after) are ignored for
determining whether to raise the exception. (Hence a write would not
actually need to change a bit of `vsip` from one to zero for the exception to
be raised.) In particular, if register `vstimecmp` is implemented (from extension
Sstc), then attempts from VS-mode to write to `stimecmp` (or, for RV32 only, `stimecmph`)
cause a virtual instruction exception when VTI = 1.

[NOTE]
====
For the standard local interrupts (major identities 13-23 and 32-47),
and for software interrupts (SSI), the corresponding interrupt-pending
bits in `vsip` are defined as "sticky," meaning a guest can clear them only
by writing directly to `sip` (really `vsip`). Among the standard-defined interrupts,
that leaves only timer interrupts (STI), which can potentially be
cleared in `vsip` by writing a new value to `vstimecmp`.
====

All `hvictl` fields together can affect the value of CSR `vstopi` (Virtual Supervisor Top
Interrupt) and therefore the interrupt identity reported in `vscause` when an
interrupt traps to VS-mode. IID is a *WARL* unsigned integer field with at
least 6 implemented bits, while IPRIO is always the full 8 bits. If
latexmath:[$k$] bits are implemented for IID, then all values 0 through
latexmath:[${2}^{k}-{1}$] are supported, and a write to `hvictl` sets
IID equal to bits (latexmath:[${15}+k$]):16 of the value written.

For a virtual interrupt specified for VS level by `hvictl`, if VTI = 1 and
latexmath:[${IID} \neq {9}$], field DPR (Default Priority
Rank) determines the interrupt’s presumed default priority order
relative to a (virtual) supervisor external interrupt (SEI), major
identity 9, as follows:

[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",cols="^",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|0 = interrupt has higher default priority than an SEI
|1 = interrupt has lower default priority than an SEI
|===

When `hvictl`.IID = 9, DPR is ignored.

[NOTE]
====
Register `hvictl` has no effect on any of `mip`, `sip`, `hip`, or `vsip`;
it affects only `vstopi` and the trapping of some instructions.
====

[[vstopi]]
==== Virtual supervisor top interrupt CSR (`vstopi`)

Read-only CSR `vstopi` is VSXLEN bits wide and has the same format as `stopi`:

[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",cols="^",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|bits 27:16 IID
|bits 7:0   IPRIO
|===

`vstopi` returns information about the highest-priority interrupt for VS level,
found from among these candidates (prefixed by + signs):

* if bit 9 is one in both `vsip` and `vsie`, `hstatus`.VGEIN is the valid number of a guest
interrupt file, and `vstopei` is not zero:
** + a supervisor external interrupt (code 9) with the priority number indicated by `vstopei`;
* if bit 9 is one in both `vsip` and `vsie`, `hstatus`.VGEIN = 0, and `hvictl` fields IID = 9 and
latexmath:[${IPRIO} \neq {0}$]:
** + a supervisor external interrupt (code 9) with priority number `hvictl`.IPRIO;
* if bit 9 is one in both `vsip` and `vsie`, and neither of the first two cases
applies:
** + a supervisor external interrupt (code 9) with priority number 256;
* if `hvictl`.VTI = 0:
** + the highest-priority pending-and-enabled major interrupt indicated by `vsip` and `vsie`
other than a supervisor external interrupt (code 9), using the priority numbers assigned
by `hviprio1` and `hviprio2`;
* if `hvictl` fields VTI = 1 and latexmath:[${IID} \neq {9}$]:
** + the major interrupt specified by `hvictl` fields IID, DPR, and IPRIO.

In the list above, all "supervisor" external interrupts are virtual,
directed to VS level, having major code 9 at VS level.

[NOTE]
====
The list of candidate interrupts can be reduced to two finalists
relatively easily by observing that the first three list items are
mutually exclusive of one another, and the remaining two items are also
mutually exclusive of one another.
====

[NOTE]
====
When `hvictl`.VTI = 1, the absence of an interrupt for VS level can be indicated
only by setting `hvictl`.IID = 9. Software might want to use the pair IID = 9,
IPRIO = 0 generally to represent _no interrupt_ in `hvictl`.
====

When no interrupt candidates satisfy the conditions of the list above,
`vstopi` is zero. Else, `vstopi` fields IID and IPRIO are determined by the
highest-priority interrupt from among the candidates. The usual priority
order for supervisor level applies, as specified by
<<TableintrPrios-S>>, except that priority
numbers are taken from the candidate list above, not from the
supervisor-level `iprio` array. Ties in nominal priority are broken as usual by
the default priority order from
<<TablemajorIntrs>>, unless `hvictl` fields VTI = 1 and
latexmath:[${IID} \neq {9}$] (last item in the candidate list
above), in which case default priority order is determined solely by
`hvictl`.DPR. If bit IPRIOM (IPRIO Mode) of `hvictl` is zero, IPRIO in `vstopi` is 1; else, if the
priority number for the highest-priority candidate is within the range 1
to 255, IPRIO is that value; else, IPRIO is set to either 0 or 255 in
the manner documented for `stopi` in <<stopi>>.

==== Interrupt traps to VS-mode

The Advanced Interrupt Architecture modifies the H extension
such that an interrupt is pending at VS level if and only
if `vstopi` is not zero. CSRs `vsip` and `vsie` do not by themselves determine whether a
VS-level interrupt is pending, though they may do so indirectly through
their effect on `vstopi`.

Whenever `vstopi` is not zero, if either the current privilege mode is VS-mode
and the SIE bit in CSR `vsstatus` is one, or the current privilege mode is VU-mode,
a trap is taken to VS-mode for the interrupt indicated by field IID of `vstopi`.

The Exception Code field of `vscause` must implement at least as many bits as
needed to represent the largest value that field IID of `vstopi` can have for the
given hart.
