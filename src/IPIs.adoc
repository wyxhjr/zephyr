[[IPIs]]
== Interprocessor Interrupts (IPIs)

By default, unless a platform has a different mechanism for
interprocessor interrupts (IPIs), the base RISC-V Privileged Architecture specifies
that a machine with multiple harts must provide for each hart an
implementation-defined memory address that can be written to signal a
machine-level _software interrupt_ (major code 3) at that hart. IPIs at
machine level can thus be sent to any hart as machine-level software
interrupts.

[NOTE]
====
A RISC-V software interrupt acts only as a minimal "doorbell" signal.
Software at the receiving hart is responsible for recognizing an
incoming software interrupt as an IPI and decoding its purpose further,
usually making use of additional data stored by the sender in ordinary
memory.
====

The same kind of mechanism (but with a different set of memory
addresses) may or may not exist for signaling supervisor-level software
interrupts (major code 1) at remote harts as well. If not directly
supported in this way, a supervisor-level software interrupt is
typically sent to another hart instead through an environment call from
supervisor mode to machine mode. An operating system running in S-mode
thus invokes a specific SBI function for delivering a software interrupt
to another hart, causing machine-level software at the originating hart
to send a machine-level IPI to the destination hart, where software then
sets the supervisor-level software interrupt-pending bit (SSIP) in CSR `mip`.

When harts have IMSICs, instead of using the base Privileged Architecture's
mechanism for signaling software interrupts at remote harts, an IPI can
be sent to a hart by writing to the destination hart's IMSIC, the same
as a regular message-signaled interrupt (MSI). In that case, an incoming
IPI appears at the destination hart as an _external interrupt_ routed
through the IMSIC, rather than as a software interrupt as before.
However, so long as the same software (e.g. an operating system or
machine monitor) is in control at both endpoints of an IPI, source and
destination, there should be no reason for a destination hart to
misinterpret the purpose of an incoming external interrupt that
represents an IPI.

If harts do not have IMSICs, then the method specified by the base Privileged
Architecture is assumed to be used for IPIs, signaling software
interrupts at destination harts. On the other hand, when harts have
IMSICs, the machinery for triggering software interrupts at remote harts
is redundant with the capabilities of the IMSICs, so it is downgraded
from a requirement to an option, useful perhaps only to provide software
compatibility across a range of RISC-V systems, with and without IMSICs. If a
machine implements IMSICs and not the earlier software-interrupt
mechanism, then the bits of CSRs `mip` and `mie` for machine-level software
interrupts, MSIP and MSIE, are hardwired to zero in harts.

[NOTE]
====
If a machine implements IMSICs but not the software-interrupt mechanism,
the latter can still be fully emulated at supervisor level for S-mode or
VS-mode, by trapping on writes to the special memory addresses that
should signal supervisor-level software interrupts at remote harts. On
such a trap, software can send a higher-level IPI via IMSIC to the
destination hart, where the higher-level software then can set the SSIP
bit in `sip` at the intended privilege level, S or VS.

Similarly, SBI environment calls for sending IPIs can easily continue to
be supported without clients being at all aware of a change in the
underlying hardware for delivering IPIs between harts.
====

[NOTE]
====
When software sends IPIs by writing MSIs to the IMSICs of other harts,
programmers should consider also the need to execute a FENCE instruction
before each store instruction that writes such an MSI. In the absence of
FENCEs, many systems guarantee to preserve the order of a hart's loads
and stores only to/from individual devices, not among multiple devices,
and not at all for accesses to main memory. With such a system, it must
be remembered that each IMSIC is likely to be considered a separate
device among the many. For example, if hart A wants to notify hart B
that it has completed a task involving accesses to some I/O device,
hart A may need to execute a FENCE before sending an MSI to B's IMSIC,
to ensure that all of A's accesses to the device have actually completed
before the MSI could arrive at B. Similarly, if hart A stores anything
to memory that should be visible at hart B, a FENCE is likely needed
before a subsequent store sending an MSI to B's IMSIC.
